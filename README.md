Word Segmentation</h2>

<h3 align="left">
Word segmentation is just one of the techniques used to divide text documents into meaningful parts.This situation is not so easy for computer algorithms when we can easily separate the words in the text. The fact that the algorithm will get “meaningful” information from the text will be as meaningful as the words used to train the algorithm with approaches such as machine learning and deep learning used. It is possible to extract relatively meaningful information according to the referenced data. Another technique used in word segmentation is the image processing stages by adding one after another.
